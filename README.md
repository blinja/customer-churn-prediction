# customer-churn-prediction
Customer churn prediction project using Random Forest. Achieved 95% accuracy on telecom dataset. Key predictors include contract type and offers. The model helps identify potential churners, providing actionable insights for retention strategies.

Telco Customer Churn Prediction:

Welcome to my first machine learning project! In this project, I explored customer churn prediction using a telecom dataset, where the main goal was to identify which customers are most likely to churn (cancel their service). Churn is a critical metric for companies as it directly impacts their revenue, customer retention efforts, and overall growth. When a customer churns, it means they've stopped doing business with the company, often switching to a competitor. This can be due to a variety of factors like poor service, pricing, or even contract details. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers, such as offering discounts, improving service quality, or addressing common concerns.

In this project, I used a Random Forest classifier, a popular machine learning model, to predict customer churn based on various features such as contract type, internet service, and customer tenure. After training and evaluating the model, I achieved an impressive accuracy of 95%, meaning the model correctly identified customer churn scenarios with high precision. Some of the key features contributing to the prediction included contract types, whether the customer had unlimited data, and specific offers they might have accepted.

This project was an exciting learning experience, and I’m really proud of how far I’ve come in my journey as a data scientist. However, I’m fully aware that there’s always room for improvement, and I’m eager to keep growing my skills in machine learning and data analytics. I invite everyone to take a look at my work, provide feedback, or even suggest enhancements. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just getting started like me, your insights are valuable, and I'd love to collaborate on improving this project further.
